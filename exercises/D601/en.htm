<p>To format a number as currency, we can add a leading dollar sign ($) to the number, and add commas to separate every three digits. For example, the currency format of \texttt{123} is \texttt{$123} and the currency format of \texttt{12345678} is \texttt{$12,345,678}. Please write a function to format the given number $x$ as currency.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
	You should implement one function:<br>
	Pascal: \texttt{procedure format(x: longint)}<br>
	C/C++: \texttt{void format(int x)}<br>
	\texttt{x}: the positive integer you need to format ($1 \le x \le 10^9$).
</p>

<p>
	In this function, you should call the following function exactly once to report your answer:<br>
	Pascal: \texttt{procedure answer(s: string)}<br>
	C/C++: \texttt{void answer(char s[])}<br>
	\texttt{s}: a string that contains your answer.
</p>

<p>After calling \texttt{answer(s)}, your function should terminate immediately.</p>
