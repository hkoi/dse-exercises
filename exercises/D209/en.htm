<p>You will be given a list of integers. Write a program to check whether the list satisfies the following rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All numbers should be larger than 100, but smaller than 50000.
	<li>All numbers should be distinct.
	<li>All numbers should be sorted in ascending order.
</ul>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains one integer $N$, the length of the list. ($1 \le N \le 10$)</p>
<p>The second line contains the list of $N$ integers. The values are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$ (the range of 32-bit integer).</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output \texttt{Valid} if the list satisfies all the rules above, else output \texttt{Invalid}.</p>
