During each term, there are two tests and one final exam for each subject. You are trying to compute the the weighted total scores. Each test carries 20% weight and the final exam carries 60%.

Write 4 SQL statements:

1. Compute the weighted total score of all subjects. Use `subject` and `weighted_total` as the column names.

For the following statements, output a single column named `subject`.

2. Find the subjects that the weighted total score is at least $90$.
3. Find the subjects that the final exam score is greater or equal to scores of both tests.
4. Find the subjects that the scores of the first test and the second test differ by more than $10$.
