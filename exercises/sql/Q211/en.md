You are learning about the rules of Mark Six. Players select 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 49. In each draw, 6 Drawn Numbers plus one Extra Number is drawn. The player wins the first prize if the 6 chosen numbers match the 6 Drawn Numbers.

You have generated some random Mark Six tickets and stored them into a database. In each row, the chosen numbers are stored from smallest to largest in order. Now, you would like to do some analysis on the tickets.

Write 4 SQL statements:

1. Assume that the 6 Drawn Numbers are 4, 16, 28, 30, 45, 47. Retrieve the ticket IDs that wins the first prize.
2. Retrieve the ticket IDs that the 6 chosen numbers are consecutive numbers (e.g. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
3. Retrieve the ticket IDs that the color of the ball of the smallest chosen number is blue. The blue balls are: 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 25, 26, 31, 36, 37, 41, 42, 47, 48.
4. Assume that the Extra Number is 36. Retrieve the ticket IDs that successfully pick the Extra Number.
