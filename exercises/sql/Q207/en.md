You are playing Scrabble with your friend, but you are not good at it. Write some SQL queries to help you find out what words you can make with certain tiles.

The `dictionary` table contains a list of allowed words.

Write 4 SQL statements:

1. There is a double-letter square, with letters `AR` next to it. You want to place just one tile on the square. Find the 3-letter word(s) that ends with `AR`.
2. There is a triple-word square. To the left of it is a letter `T` and to the right of it is a letter `S`. Find the word(s) that has a `T`, an `S` and exactly one letter between them.
3. The letter `Q` is worth 10 points. You have one `Q` and one `U`. Find the word(s) that you that has exactly one `Q`, exactly one `U` and some other letters in it.
4. The letter `Z` is also worth 10 points. Find the word(s) that you that the length is at least 5 and has at least one `Z` in the first 5 letters.
